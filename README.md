 Project 2 : Rule-Based Expert System 🤖

As part of my Artificial Intelligence internship at Syntecxhub, I built a small rule engine capable of reasoning like an expert! 

Key highlights:
✅ Designed an if-then rules engine with a dynamic facts base
 ✅ Allowed user input of symptoms to infer conclusions automatically
 ✅ Implemented forward chaining for multi-step reasoning
 ✅ Enabled transparent reasoning by logging each inference step
 ✅ Demonstrated AI decision-making logic in a simple, understandable way

This project strengthened my skills in knowledge-based AI systems and logical inference, showing how computers can mimic expert reasoning.

💡 Next step: expanding the system for complex decision-making in real-world applications like medical diagnosis or troubleshooting.
